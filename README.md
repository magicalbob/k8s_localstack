Localstack in k8s
=================

A simple deployment of AWS LocalStack.

Run `./install-localstack.sh` to deploy it.

The install script runs `kubectl port-forward service/localstack-gateway-service -n localstack --address 127.0.0.1 4566:4566 &` at the end so that you can then do things like:

	aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 dynamodb list-tables 

Currently configured for sts and dynamodb aws services.
